Using GoogleMaps API and TripAdvisor's API we developed an app 
to tell you, when you are going on a road trip, where you will be when you 
want food, entertainment or a hotel. 

For example: 
If you are leaving for a road trip from New York to Boston at 10am, you 
know you may be hungry around 12pm. Using GoogleMaps, Daytripr will figure 
out where you will be at 12pm and give you restaurant recommendations using
TripAdvisor's restaurant data. We hope to provide a better road trip experience.
